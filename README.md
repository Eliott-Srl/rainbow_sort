# Rainbow Sort

**Rainbow Sort** is a program which sort images into the rainbow order.

## Origin
The idea behind this program is that I wanted to sort by color the books in my shelve. The challenge was to do this only in C++.

## Sources
For the sort method I've read those articles:
* [The incredibly challenging task of sorting colours](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2015/09/30/colour-sorting/)
* [Change RGB color model to HSV color model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-change-rgb-color-model-hsv-color-model/)

For the image treatment library:
* [Tutorial for the library (stb_image)](https://solarianprogrammer.com/2019/06/10/c-programming-reading-writing-images-stb_image-libraries/)

## Usage
You run the program or you specify the absolute path or you put your images in a folder named 'img' in the same folder as the exe.
